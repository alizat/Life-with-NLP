# Life-with-NLP
Pet projects involving NLP tasks

Done so far:
- [classifying_emotions.ipynb](classifying_emotions.ipynb)
  - Text tokenization, embeddings, and classification with DistilBERT + fine-tuning on the [Emotions dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/emotion)
- [encoder_decoder.ipynb](encoder_decoder.ipynb)
  - demonstration of encoder-decoder-style neural networks
- [summarization.ipynb](summarization.ipynb)
  - demonstration of summarization via some of the popular transformer models out there as well as a couple of evaluation metrics that are used to model performance on summarization tasks

***I will keep on adding more notebooks to this repo. Stay tuned!***
